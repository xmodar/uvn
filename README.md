[`uvn`](https://github.com/xmodar/uvn) is [`conda`](https://conda.io) for [`uv`](https://astral.sh/uv); a centralized Python virtual environment manager.

## Highlights

- üéØ **Centralized Environments**: Manage all environments in a single location.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Compatibility with `uv`**: Designed to complement `uv` and streamline environment management.
- üóÇÔ∏è **Export Options**: Quickly export environment configurations as `requirements.txt` or inline metadata.
- üíæ **Cloning**: Clone existing environments to create new ones easily.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Simple CLI Interface**: Easily list, create, activate, and remove environments with straightforward commands.
- üöÄ **Minimal Dependencies**: Built with simplicity and speed in mind.

## Installation

Install `uv`.

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# On Windows.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Then, install `uvn`.

```bash
uv tool install uvn
```

`uvn` can be installed via `pip` or with `uv`, though using `uv` is recommended for streamlined integration.

## Usage

After installing `uvn`, you can use it to manage virtual environments that remain centralized and accessible from anywhere, just like `conda`.
